# traffic_sign_classification

In this Python project example, we will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.

For this project, we are using the public dataset available at Kaggle:
